Hey this repo contains the solution to exercises given in the last section of the SQL course.
To be honest, most of times I am so lazy when it comes to create plots (and yet they are very useful) so one of the biggest challenged I faced at the exercises was overcome that **piggy mindset** and get the stuff done.
As you may notice, I used Bokeh instead of Matplotlib. *For me, it is easier creating plots on Bokeh (Or maybe is because I have not given Matplotlib that much chance :thinking:)*.
Anyways, I just want to say this is a great course if you do not know anything when it comes to SQL programming language; I learned a lot and the exercises with Python were fun.

`if` dalto sees this, let me thank you for what you are doing to the LATAM community &#129761;
